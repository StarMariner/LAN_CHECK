# LAN_CHECK
WINDOWS Batch file script

Checks local area Network. Collects basic info, IP adddress, NSlookup name and graphical connection status. 
Infinite Loops every 20 seconds or quicker if user presses any key. Exit the loop using CTRL+C or CTRL+break.

Adapt it to your hearts content, this works for me, I hope its what you may be looking for too. Yes its very legacy, but I find it a bit quicker than some free GUI versions I've seen.

I am not responsible for any damage or loss using this code, its a script and so not perfect.
